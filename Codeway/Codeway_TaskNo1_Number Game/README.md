Welcome to the Number Game project in Java! This simple GUI-based game is designed to showcase basic programming concepts using the Java programming language.<br>

## Instructions of the Game:
1.Generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.<br>
2. Prompt the user to enter their guess for the generated number.<br>
3. Compare the user's guess with the generated number and provide feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.<br>
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number.<br>
**Additionally I have also included the following** :ðŸ‘‡<br>
