# ATM Interface Using Java GUI üèß

This project implements a basic ATM interface using Java GUI. Users can perform common banking transactions such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking the account balance through a graphical user interface.<br>

## Features:

1. **Withdraw:** Users can withdraw a specified amount from their account.<br>
2. **Deposit:** Users can deposit a specified amount into their account.<br>
3. **Check Balance:** Users can check their account balance.<br>
4. **Exit:** Users can exit the ATM interface.<br>

## Steps followed for creation of ATM Interface in java:
1. Create a class to represent the ATM machine.<br>
2. Design the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.<br>
3. Implement methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and checkBalance().<br>
4. Create a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance.<br>
5. Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account balance.<br>
6. Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).<br>
7. Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure of their transactions.<br>

## Technologies Used
